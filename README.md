# Relational Databases and Bash Scripting

FINALLY DONE RELATIONAL DATABASES ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

I learned a lot from this, even though it may have been the basics of SQL, Bash and Git (and Nano) it was a fun experience at the end. As you might see, I spent the last half January on this. That is because I realized these set of courses were actually useful even after I finished by Unix/C course back in December. Now I do a lot more tasks in Git Bash! Another plus side that I got from this is that I can type without looking at my keyboard a lot more now (still use 3 fingers though!). 

Another thing I would like to add is that I spent some time on making my own Reference sheet explaining what other commands do and what I used in this short journey. I saved in a word file and it may be messy (9 pages, 4k words), but I'm glad I learned how to take notes on online things like this. Anyways here is my completion dates

RATING:

I will give this Course/Certification a 7/10. Pretty good, but it was quite reptitive with the content. Yes it was for practice, but it was starting to make me bored. Also there were a lot of bugs which is a whole other story and which I want to forget about. It was still good content for a beginner in bash and postgresql

(pm me the expressionless face emoji if you looked at this part)
